Trying to run DeepSqueak training detection model... Running into errors.
Got the thing working so far. Currently running. It failed when I tried training alone or with Mouse Call network, but worked with All Short... Idk why.
Just ran it through; it failed on second step. "Error using gpuArray/hTimesTranspose \ Call to sgemm in CUBLAS failed with error status:CUBLAS_STATUS_EXECUTION_FAILED.

It worked. I think that the errors might be some time of GPU overload... I tried to just train the model 1-by-1 instead and it worked fine. I also just redid it using all the tables at once and it worked. Tomorrow (5/28/20) will be all DeepSqueak.

Gonna start up DeepSqueak stuff today. See where I'm at, see what else I need to do.
I see I've finished my detection network. I'm gonna run it on T000002 and see how well it did.
Ran on T000002. Detected 275 calls vs the 365 manual inputs.
I ran T00002 through the default Mouse_Call_Network_V2 and it generated 287. This might be more promising -- will train a neural network on that and see what happens.
Ran custom-trained Mouse_Call_Network_V2 on T000002, produced 262 calls. Still trying to figure out which is best.
Training network from scratch using OPA data. Let's see how it works.
195 calls detected from network_from_scratch on T000002. Going to take a break from detection networks, see what I can do with Post Hoc Denoising.
Custom_Trained_On Mouse_Call_Network with high recall slider all the way up results in 356 calls. Most accurate. (Might be due to bias in already seeing T00002 but whatever. Works for me.)
Going back and relabeling all noises as Noise, as negatives for Post Hoc Denoising.
Trained a Post Hoc Denoiser. Didn't try to see if it worked well. I think it did. Don't have anything good to test it on considering none of the detections really have a lot of noise.
Think I'm done now with DeepSqueak. Taking a break and gonna work on the pipeline now.

Going to finish generate_stats_group.
Finished generate_stats_group. Taking break, going to move on to entry.py to add functionality to choose their own group.
